# VisualSorting

An interactive visualisation of 5 in-place sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Heapsort and Quick Sort. Up to 200 elements can be sorted as of August 2021. 

This visualisation was built to get some practice writing code in Javascript. The idea to use JS Promises when swapping array elements comes from [this article](https://gosink.in/bubble-sort-css-javascript-animation/). 

Features that I'm considering adding (in no particular order):
- Ability to specify min/max array element values 
- Ability to change sorting speed
- Ability to un-sort a sorted array instead of generating a completely new one
- More sorting algorithms (bogo sort????)
- Audio effects
